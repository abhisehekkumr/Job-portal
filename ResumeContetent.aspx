      <li>Name of the employer and dates (if applicable)</li>

      When writing the summary of accomplishments and responsibilities, explain concisely the duties relevant to the position you are seeking. Emphasize the responsibilities and skills that would readily transfer to your next job. Be careful not to overstate your duties. Use <a href="#">action words</a> to describe your qualifications. Use <a href="#">key words</a> if you are writing a scannable resume.

      Final considerations are the selection of text, fonts, paper, printing and mailing methods.

      <ul>
      <li>
      <br />
     <b>Text</b>  The most popular typefaces are <b>( new century schoolbook, bookman, times, courier )</b>.
      </li>

      <li>
      <br />

     <b> Fonts </b>(type size). Two types are generally used, <b>10-point and 12-point</b>. An exception to this could be a header typed in a large font to highlight your name.
      </li>

      <li>
      <br />

      <b>Paper and Envelopes :</b> Resumes, cover letters and thank you letters should be printed on a high quality cotton paper. These choices reflect your style, your attention to detail and thoroughness. Variations are acceptable in some instances if they accentuate or highlight your field of interest or expertise.
      </li>

      <li>
      <br />

      <b>Printing Methods:</b> Always use a quality method of printing, such as a laser printer. If you do not use this, then have your resume typeset. Use graphics very sparingly or not at all unless their use appears appropriate for the field for which you are applying.
      </li>

      <li>
      <br />

      <b>Mailing/Distribution:</b> If you fax a resume, use white paper. Use the largest font which comfortably fits within your resume margins. Always mail or deliver a original to the prospective employer the same day. When doing a global job search, consider the electronic resume. Some local printing companies can help with the service of on-line resumes, but consider the fees and confidentiality issues involved in this choice.
